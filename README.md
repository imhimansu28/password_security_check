# Password Security Checker Documentation

### Overview
This code is designed to check the security of a password by comparing it with a database of known compromised passwords. The key features of this code are:

- Password Security Check: Users can pass a password as an argument to the code, and it will check if the password is compromised or not.
- API Integration: The code integrates with the Have I Been Pwned API to fetch the data of compromised passwords.

### Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code file is saved.
3. Run the following command: `python password_checker.py <password>`.
4. Replace `<password>` with the password you want to check.
5. Press enter to execute the code.
6. The code will check if the password is compromised or not.
7. If the password is found in the database, the code will display a message that the password was found and how many times it was found.
8. If the password is not found in the database, the code will display a message that the password was not found.

### Limitations
- This code only checks if the password is compromised or not. It does not check if the password is strong or not.
- This code requires an active internet connection to fetch data from the Have I Been Pwned API.
- This code should not be used to check passwords that are currently in use as it sends the password in plain text over the internet.
